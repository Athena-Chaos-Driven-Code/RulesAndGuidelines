## Supported Python Versions
Although various programmers like to support older version, [Athena's Chaos Drive Code](https://github.com/Athena-Chaos-Driven-Code) is meant to work with the latest versions of Python. This means that older versions of Python are never supposed to be natively supported in the various projects. 

**Currently supported Python Version :** [3.11.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/) 
- If this version of Python is still in an early release state, or the version has just come out, updating all the packages might take some time

A singular exception to this is [AthenaColor](https://github.com/Athena-Chaos-Driven-Code/AthenaColor), due to maintainer's request. 
This project will be supported from 3.7 and onwards.
